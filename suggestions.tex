Most important:
    1. Fix team hub so it is fully usable in the spring, that way I dont have to keep linking things in group me.
        a. Addiontionally, domain lock it, make it on the site so it isn't on a jankey word doc. 
            a1. We COULD use Firebase or some other database for this, OR we could just do a dummy check.
    2. In Spring we are introducing a practice schedule with workouts, routes, safety officers, etc. 
        a. Integrate this into the website in a similar way that Michigan does. We should have workouts posted, routes w/maps maybe?
